Cabrillo Log Format for the CQ WW DX Contest
Cabrillo refers to a universal log file format managed by the World Wide Radio Operators Foundation (WWROF). Cabrillo is the required format for CQ WW DX Contest logs.

There are two versions of the Cabrillo log file format. The CQ WW DX Contest accepts both Cabrillo v2 and v3 format files. One of the major changes from v2 to v3 was in the way categories are specified. We strongly request that you submit logs using the Cabrillo v3 format if possible.
